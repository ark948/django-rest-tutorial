add snippets and rest_framework to installed apps
add model to snippets app
make and run migrations
add serializer for snippet model in a new file called serializers.py in snippet app
test the serializer in django shell
refactor the serializer with modelSerializer
write some regular django views
wire the views with snippet/urls.py (add urls.py file)
wire up the snippet urls to main urls
tried to run server, error was raised, unapplied migrations
ran migrations
start server again. works.
part 2 of tutorial: django regular views will be refactored to django rest framework views
two views were added, using api_view decorator for list and detail pages
adding format suffix to urls (allows us to access urls with specific formats like json)

part 3, class-based views.
views.py will be refactored with classes.
snippets/urls.py also gets refactored a bit. (add as_view)
git commit

using mixins: will allows us to easily compose reusable bits of behavior.
using generics will gives us even further conciseness.
